# bday-email
Python script that will send a personalized birthday message over email


## Random Joke
This is a random joke pulled from API by [KegenGuyII](https://github.com/KegenGuyll/DadJokes_API)
* Could add in where when joke is sent to person we append a set with the joke number so we don't retell any jokes to people

## Main
Pretty simple code
* Get our dictionary of people's name/birthday(concatenated) and their email
* Check if any of them have a birthday today
* If they do, post request our backend email sender on my website
